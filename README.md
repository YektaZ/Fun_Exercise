### Problem Statement 

Create the following functions: 

> - [x] number_to_words(), which takes as an argument a string representing a US phone number and which outputs a string which has transformed part or all of the phone number into a single "wordified" phone number that can be typed on a US telephone (for example, a valid output of number_to_words("1-800-724-6837") could be ("1-800-PAINTER"). If you find it makes things simpler, feel free to constrain this function to only output "wordifications" in English.
> - [x] words_to_number(), which does the reverse of the above function (for example, the output of words_to_number("1-800-PAINTER") should be ("1-800-724-6837")
> - [x] all_wordifications(), which outputs all possible combinations of numbers and English words in a phone number.

### Solution
Please open the '$$OpenME$$.ipynb' with Jupyter notebook.
Inside you can find the three main functions that the problem has asked for:
- number_to_words()
- words_to_numbers()
- all_wordifications()
Multiple other functions have been created to make the task easier. I have added comments on each section to make is easire to walk through the functions.
